# FastAPI Documentation

> Modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python

## Overview
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints. Automatic OpenAPI documentation, async support, and dependency injection out of the box.

## Core Concepts
- **Path Operations**: Define API endpoints with decorators
- **Type Hints**: Automatic validation and serialization
- **Dependency Injection**: Reusable components and auth
- **Async Support**: Native async/await for high performance

## Quick Start
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

## Documentation Structure
- \[Tutorial\](/tutorial) - Step-by-step guide for beginners
- \[Advanced Guide\](/advanced) - Complex patterns and optimization
- \[API Reference\](/reference) - Complete API documentation
- \[Deployment\](/deployment) - Production deployment guides

- \[Database Integration\](/tutorial/sql-databases)
- \[Testing\](/tutorial/testing)
- \[WebSockets\](/advanced/websockets)

## Comparisons
- vs Flask: Faster, type hints, async native
- vs Django REST: Lighter, modern, auto-docs
- vs Express: Python ecosystem, type safety

# Zod

> TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference

## Overview
Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. Define a schema once and Zod will automatically infer the static TypeScript type. Zero dependencies.

## Why Zod
- TypeScript-first: Infers types from schemas
- Zero dependencies: Small bundle size
- Composable: Build complex schemas from simple ones
- Ecosystem: Works with React Hook Form, tRPC, Prisma

## Installation
```bash
npm install zod
```

## Basic Usage
```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const UserSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().min(0).optional(),
});

type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;
// { name: string; email: string; age?: number }
```

## Schema Types
- Primitives: string, number, boolean, date
- Objects: object, array, tuple, record
- Advanced: union, intersection, discriminatedUnion
- Modifiers: optional, nullable, default

- Include huge code blocks (link instead)
- Omit pricing/key information
- Use vague descriptions

### Maintenance
- Update when features change
- Review quarterly for accuracy
- Test by asking AI systems about your product
- Track AI citation rates
