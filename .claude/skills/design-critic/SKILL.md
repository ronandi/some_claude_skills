# Design Critic

AI partner with trained aesthetic taste for assessing, scoring, and remixing design implementations. Inspired by RL VisualQuality-R1's chain-of-thought reasoning for visual assessment.

## When to Use

✅ **Use for**:
- Reviewing UI/UX implementations for aesthetic quality
- Scoring designs on accessibility, harmony, typography, layout
- Getting remix suggestions to improve existing designs
- Comparing design alternatives objectively
- Pre-launch design quality gates

❌ **NOT for**:
- Writing CSS/HTML code (use `frontend-developer`)
- Pure accessibility audits (use `color-contrast-auditor`)
- Creating brand guidelines from scratch
- Icon/illustration creation
- Motion design choreography

## 6-Dimension Scoring System

Score each dimension 0-100:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Accessibility** | 20% | WCAG contrast, touch targets, semantic HTML, focus states |
| **Color Harmony** | 15% | Palette cohesion, temperature balance, saturation consistency |
| **Typography** | 15% | Hierarchy clarity, readability, font pairing quality |
| **Layout** | 20% | Visual balance, grid adherence, whitespace distribution |
| **Modernity** | 15% | Current trend alignment, avoiding dated patterns |
| **Usability** | 15% | Clear affordances, intuitive flow, cognitive load |

**Overall Score** = Weighted average of all dimensions

### Score Interpretation

| Range | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 90-100 | Exceptional | Portfolio-worthy, best-in-class |
| 80-89 | Excellent | Production-ready, minor polish opportunities |
| 70-79 | Good | Solid foundation, some improvements needed |
| 60-69 | Fair | Functional but needs design attention |
| Below 60 | Needs Work | Significant design issues to address |

## Assessment Workflow

### Step 1: First Impression (200ms Test)

Ask: "What does this feel like in the first 200ms?"
- Professional or amateur?
- Trustworthy or sketchy?
- Modern or dated?
- Clear or cluttered?

### Step 2: Visual Scanning Path

Trace where the eye goes:
1. Where does it land first?
2. Where does it go next?
3. Is there a clear hierarchy?
4. Are CTAs findable within 3 seconds?

### Step 3: Dimensional Analysis

For each of the 6 dimensions:
1. Apply scoring criteria
2. Note specific strengths
3. Note specific issues
4. Calculate dimension score

### Step 4: Synthesize

- Calculate weighted overall score
- Identify top 3 strengths
- Identify top 3 improvement opportunities
- Generate remix suggestions

## Scoring Criteria by Dimension

### Accessibility (20%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 90+ | WCAG AAA, excellent focus states, proper ARIA, skip links |
| 80-89 | WCAG AA, visible focus, semantic HTML, good color contrast |
| 70-79 | WCAG AA minimum, basic focus states, some semantic issues |
| 60-69 | Contrast issues, missing focus states, accessibility afterthought |
| <60 | Failing WCAG AA, inaccessible to screen readers |

**Key checks**:
- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (AA) or ≥ 7:1 (AAA)
- Large text contrast ≥ 3:1
- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px
- Focus visible on all interactive elements
- No information conveyed by color alone

### Color Harmony (15%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 90+ | Sophisticated palette, intentional relationships, emotional resonance |
| 80-89 | Cohesive palette, good accent usage, balanced saturation |
| 70-79 | Functional palette, some discord notes, safe choices |
| 60-69 | Palette feels random, competing colors, no clear system |
| <60 | Clashing colors, no color logic, jarring combinations |

**Harmony types to assess**:
- Complementary (high energy)
- Analogous (harmonious, calm)
- Triadic (vibrant, balanced)
- Split-complementary (nuanced contrast)

### Typography (15%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 90+ | Perfect hierarchy, excellent pairing, optimal line length |
| 80-89 | Clear hierarchy, good readability, intentional scale |
| 70-79 | Adequate hierarchy, some sizing issues, passable pairing |
| 60-69 | Weak hierarchy, poor line-height, questionable font choices |
| <60 | No visible hierarchy, unreadable body text, font chaos |

**Key checks**:
- Line length: 45-75 characters optimal
- Line height: 1.4-1.6 for body text
- Clear size jumps (1.25-1.618 ratio)
- Max 2-3 font families

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 90+ | Intuitive flow, zero confusion, delightful micro-interactions |
| 80-89 | Clear affordances, logical grouping, good feedback |
| 70-79 | Functional UX, some confusion points, adequate feedback |

**Key checks**:
- Primary CTA immediately visible
- Logical information architecture
- Clear feedback on interactions
- Predictable behavior
- Appropriate cognitive load

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Aesthetic Over Function

**Novice thinking**: "This looks cool, ship it"

**Reality**: Beautiful but unusable designs fail. 3.5:1 contrast "looks better" but fails WCAG. Tiny touch targets look elegant but frustrate users.

**Correct approach**: Accessibility first, then aesthetics. You can have both.

### Anti-Pattern: Trend Chasing

**Novice thinking**: "Glassmorphism is hot, use it everywhere"

**Reality**: Trends are context-dependent. Glassmorphism fails on low-contrast backgrounds. Neobrutalism alienates corporate audiences.

**Correct approach**: Choose trends that serve the content and audience. Trends are spices, not the meal.

### Anti-Pattern: Font Soup

**Novice thinking**: "More fonts = more interesting"

**Reality**: 4+ fonts = visual chaos. Even 3 fonts requires mastery to pull off.

**Correct approach**: 1-2 fonts max. Use weight/size for hierarchy, not different typefaces.

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring the Fold

**Novice thinking**: "Users scroll, put anything above the fold"

**Reality**: Above-the-fold content determines if users engage. 80% of attention goes to above-fold content.

**Correct approach**: Hero must communicate value proposition in 3 seconds. Most important CTA above fold.

## Remix Strategies

When suggesting remixes, draw from these improvement patterns:

| Issue | Remix Strategy |
|-------|----------------|
| Low contrast | Use WCAG-verified pairs from design catalog |
| Cluttered layout | Apply 8px spacing system, remove 30% of elements |
| Dated aesthetic | Suggest trend from same family (e.g., neumorphism → glassmorphism) |
| Poor hierarchy | Apply typography scale with 1.25-1.5 ratio |
| Weak CTA | Increase size 150%, add visual weight, isolation |
| Color discord | Suggest analogous palette, reduce saturation variance |

## Pairs With
