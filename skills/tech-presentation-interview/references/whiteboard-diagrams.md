# Whiteboard Diagrams for Technical Presentations

How to draw effective system architecture diagrams during interview presentations. The whiteboard is not decoration -- it is a communication tool that anchors the conversation, prevents misunderstanding, and gives you a physical reference point when answering follow-up questions.

---

## Core Principle: Progressive Disclosure

Never draw the full system at once. Start with 3 boxes and add detail only when the conversation demands it. A diagram with 15 boxes drawn at the start overwhelms the audience and removes your ability to control the narrative.

### Three-Phase Drawing Strategy

**Phase 1: The 3-Box Overview (draw during Context/Problem)**

```
[Input Source] ---> [Your System] ---> [Output / Consumer]
```

This is the highest-level abstraction. Examples:
- `[Camera Feeds] ---> [Detection Pipeline] ---> [Alert Dashboard]`
- `[User Query] ---> [Search Engine] ---> [Ranked Results]`
- `[Raw Events] ---> [Processing Pipeline] ---> [Analytics DB]`

Draw this in the first 2 minutes. It grounds the audience. Everything else is a zoom-in.

**Phase 2: Expand the Middle Box (draw during Approach & Why)**

Break "Your System" into 3-5 internal components. Only the ones you will discuss. Leave out standard infrastructure you plan to skim.

```
[Input] ---> [Component A] ---> [Component B] ---> [Component C] ---> [Output]
                  |                                      |
                  v                                      v
             [Data Store]                          [Model Store]
```

Draw this as you explain your approach. Each box appears as you introduce the component.

**Phase 3: Zoom Into 2-3 Components (draw during Architecture Deep Dive)**

For each deep component, draw a sub-diagram near the relevant box. Use a different region of the whiteboard so the overview stays visible.

```
[Component B - Detail]
+----------------------------------+
|  Request -> Validation -> Route  |
|       |                    |     |
|       v                    v     |
|  [Cache Check]      [Model Infer]|
|       |                    |     |
|       +-----> Merge <------+     |
|               |                  |
|               v                  |
|          [Response]              |
+----------------------------------+
```

## Standard Notation

Use consistent symbols so the audience builds a mental vocabulary.

| Shape | Meaning | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Rectangle / Box | Service, application, or processing component | Default for most things |
| Cylinder | Data storage (database, cache, object store) | Anytime data persists |
| Rounded rectangle | External system or third-party service | Things you don't control |
| Diamond | Decision point or router | Conditional logic, load balancers |
| Arrow (solid) | Data flow or request path | Primary paths |
| Arrow (dashed) | Async / eventual consistency / background job | Secondary paths |
| Cloud shape | External network or internet boundary | When network boundary matters |
| Double border | Your focus component (what you'll go deep on) | Highlight your deep-dive targets |

### Labeling Rules

- **Every box gets a name** (2-4 words max). Not "the service that handles incoming requests and validates them" -- just "API Gateway."
- **Arrows get labels for non-obvious flows**. `user request` is obvious. `confidence > 0.8` is not -- label it.
- **Data stores get the technology name**. "PostgreSQL" not "database." "Redis" not "cache." Specificity signals ownership.
- **Write data format on arrows when it matters**. `JSON / 200 req/s` or `protobuf / 50MB batches`. This shows you think about real-world constraints.

## Color and Shading Strategy

Most interview whiteboard setups provide 3-4 marker colors. Use them intentionally.

### Color Assignment (Physical Whiteboard)

| Color | Use For | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Black | All boxes, labels, and primary text | Foundation -- always readable |
| Blue | Data flow arrows and paths | Distinct from structure |
| Red | Failure modes, problem areas, things you'd change | Draws attention to critical points |
| Green | Metrics, results, success indicators | Positive association |

### If Only Black is Available

Use these differentiation techniques:
- **Line weight**: Thick borders for your deep-dive components, thin for context
- **Fill patterns**: Hash marks inside boxes you own, empty for others
- **Underline**: Underline the component name you're about to discuss
- **Asterisk**: Mark components with known failure modes

### Virtual Whiteboard (tldraw, Excalidraw)

For remote interviews with digital whiteboards:

| Feature | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| Color palette | Pre-set 4 colors before the interview starts: black, blue, red, green |
| Shape library | Use built-in shapes, don't draw freehand (faster, cleaner) |
| Text size | Minimum 18pt -- the interviewer may have a smaller screen |
| Zoom level | Start at 75% zoom so you have room to expand |
| Arrangement | Left-to-right flow for main pipeline, top-to-bottom for zoom-ins |
| Undo | Use it aggressively. Messy diagrams on digital whiteboards look worse than messy physical ones |

---

## Space Management (Physical Whiteboard)

### Board Layout

Divide the whiteboard into regions before you start drawing:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                          |
|   [OVERVIEW DIAGRAM]              [ZOOM-IN AREA 1]      |
|   (left 60%)                      (upper right 40%)     |
|                                                          |
|                                   [ZOOM-IN AREA 2]      |
|                                   (lower right 40%)     |
|                                                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|   [METRICS / NUMBERS]   (bottom strip, 15% of board)    |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Space Rules

- **Never fill more than 70% of the whiteboard**. You need room for Q&A additions.
- **Leave the overview visible** even as you add zoom-ins. Interviewers will point at the overview and ask about specific components.
- **Reserve the bottom strip** for metrics, numbers, and quick calculations you do during Q&A.
- **Erase zoom-ins when done** if you need the space for a different component. The overview should persist for the full session.

### Erasing Strategy

- Erase zoom-in detail after discussing it and before drawing the next zoom-in (recycles space)
- NEVER erase the overview diagram (it's the anchor)
- If you make a mistake, erase and redraw. Do not scribble over errors -- it looks worse

## Common Diagram Patterns

### Pattern 1: Request Flow (API / Web Service)

```
[Client] --> [Load Balancer] --> [API Server] --> [Business Logic]
                                      |                |
                                      v                v
                                 [Auth Service]  [Database]
                                                     |
                                                     v
                                               [Cache Layer]
```

Use when: Presenting a web service, API, or request-response system.
Deep dive targets: Business logic layer, caching strategy, auth mechanism.

### Pattern 2: Data Pipeline (ETL / Streaming)

```
[Sources]     [Ingestion]     [Processing]     [Storage]     [Serving]
  S1 ---+
  S2 ---+--> [Kafka] -----> [Spark/Flink] ---> [Data Lake] --> [Query Engine]
  S3 ---+                       |                                    |
                                v                                    v
                          [Dead Letter]                       [Dashboard]
                          [Queue]
```

Use when: Presenting data engineering, ETL, analytics, or streaming systems.
Deep dive targets: Processing logic, data quality checks, failure handling / DLQ.

### Pattern 3: ML Training Loop

```
[Raw Data] --> [Feature Engineering] --> [Training Pipeline] --> [Model Registry]
                      |                        |                       |
                      v                        v                       v
               [Feature Store]          [Experiment Tracker]    [Model Serving]
                                        (MLflow / W&B)               |
                                                                     v
                                                              [A/B Framework]
                                                                     |
                                                                     v
                                                              [Production Traffic]
```

Use when: Presenting ML infrastructure, model training, or MLOps work.
Deep dive targets: Feature engineering pipeline, training pipeline (data loading, distributed training), model serving (batching, caching, canary deployment).

### Pattern 4: ML Serving Architecture

```
[Request] --> [Feature Lookup] --> [Model Server] --> [Post-Processing] --> [Response]
                   |                     |                    |
                   v                     v                    v
             [Feature Cache]      [Model Cache]        [Business Rules]
             (Redis, 15min TTL)   (in-memory)          (threshold, filter)
                   |
                   v
             [Feature Store]
             (offline computed)
```

Use when: Presenting production ML inference, recommendation systems, or real-time prediction services.
Deep dive targets: Feature lookup latency optimization, model serving (batching strategy, hardware allocation), post-processing rules.

### Pattern 5: Two-Tier / Edge-Cloud Architecture

```
           EDGE (per device)                      CLOUD (centralized)
+-------------------------------+    +-----------------------------------+
| [Sensor] --> [Light Model]    |    | [Heavy Model] --> [Fusion Logic] |
|                |               |--->|       ^                |         |
|                v               |    |       |                v         |
|         [Local Decision]       |    | [Batch Queue]   [Alert System]  |
|                |               |    |                                  |
|                v               |    |                                  |
|         [Local Action]         |    |                                  |
+-------------------------------+    +-----------------------------------+
```

Use when: Presenting IoT, edge computing, mobile ML, or distributed inference systems.
Deep dive targets: Edge model constraints and tradeoffs, cloud-edge communication protocol, result fusion logic.

## Timing: When to Draw vs When to Talk

| Presentation Phase | Drawing Activity |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Context (2 min) | Draw the 3-box overview while talking. Simple enough to draw and talk simultaneously. |
| Problem (3 min) | Point at the overview. Annotate with constraints (write "&lt; 200ms" on an arrow, "$180K/mo" next to a component). Do NOT draw new boxes. |
| Approach (5 min) | Expand the middle box into internal components. Draw each component as you introduce it. Pause talking briefly while drawing -- silence during drawing is fine. |
| Deep Dive (10 min) | Move to the zoom-in area. Draw sub-diagrams for your 2-3 deep components. This is where most drawing happens. |
| Results (3 min) | Write key metrics in the bottom strip or annotate the diagram with performance numbers. |
| What I'd Change (2 min) | Use red marker to circle or annotate the components you'd redesign. Powerful visual signal. |
| Q&A (15+ min) | Draw on-demand. When asked "what happens if X fails?", draw the failure path. When asked "how does Y work internally?", add a mini zoom-in. |

### Drawing Speed

- Practice drawing your overview diagram until you can do it in under 30 seconds
- Practice drawing each zoom-in diagram until you can do it in under 60 seconds
- If a diagram takes more than 90 seconds to draw, simplify it
- It is better to draw quickly and slightly messy than slowly and perfectly -- momentum matters

## Physical Whiteboard Tips

### Marker Technique
- Hold the marker at a 45-degree angle for consistent line width
- Use the flat side for thick lines (borders), the tip for thin lines (arrows)
- Cap markers when not in use -- dried-out markers ruin presentations
- Bring your own markers if the room's markers might be unreliable

### Body Position
- Stand to the side of what you're drawing, not in front of it
- Use your non-writing hand to point at the diagram while explaining
- Face the audience when talking, face the board only when drawing
- Step back periodically so the audience can see the full picture

### Recovery Moves
- Wrong box placement? Don't erase and redo -- draw an arrow to the correct location and label it. Shows adaptability.
- Ran out of space? Erase a zoom-in you've finished discussing.
- Messy handwriting? Slow down. Write in block letters. Bigger is better.
- Forgot a component? "Let me add one more piece I should have included" -- then draw it. Honesty > perfection.

## Virtual Whiteboard Tips

### Tool Selection (in order of preference for interviews)

1. **Excalidraw** (excalidraw.com) -- Hand-drawn aesthetic, collaborative, free, no account needed
2. **tldraw** (tldraw.com) -- Clean, fast, minimal UI
3. **Miro** -- If the company provides a Miro board (common for larger companies)
4. **Google Jamboard** -- Simple but limited (sunsetted in some orgs)

### Remote-Specific Techniques

- **Pre-draw the 3-box overview** 5 minutes before the interview starts. Having the overview ready when you begin saves time and shows preparation.
- **Use snap-to-grid** if available. Alignment is free professionalism.
- **Duplicate, don't redraw**. When expanding a component, copy-paste the overview and modify. Faster and preserves layout.
- **Share your screen, not the whiteboard tool**. Screen sharing gives you control. Collaborative editing can lead to accidental moves.
- **Zoom to fit** after each major addition so the interviewer sees the full picture.
- **Use sticky notes / text boxes** for labels rather than the draw tool. More readable on small screens.

### Bandwidth Considerations

- If video quality is poor, describe what you're drawing as you draw it: "I'm adding a cache layer between the API server and the database..."
- Offer to paste a text-based diagram in chat if the visual tool isn't working
- Have a backup plan: a pre-made diagram image (PNG) you can screen-share if the collaborative tool fails

## Common Drawing Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Drawing everything at once | Overwhelms audience, no narrative control | Progressive disclosure: 3 boxes -> expand -> zoom |
| No labels | Interviewer forgets what each box represents | Label every box (2-4 words) and non-obvious arrows |
| Arrows without direction | Ambiguous data flow | Always use arrowheads. Double-headed arrows only for bidirectional communication |
| Perfectly symmetric layouts | Wastes time achieving visual perfection | Speed > beauty. Rough alignment is fine. |
| Drawing while talking about something else | Audience doesn't know where to focus | Either talk OR draw. Brief silence while drawing is professional. |
| Using the board as notes | Writing paragraphs of text on the whiteboard | Diagrams and short labels only. Speak the explanations. |
| Never referring back to the diagram | Diagram becomes decoration | Point at components when discussing them. "This piece here [points] is where the interesting problem was." |
