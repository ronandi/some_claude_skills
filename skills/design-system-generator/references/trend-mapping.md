# Design Trend Mapping Reference

## Problem

When a user says "I want a modern tech startup look" or "something bold for an indie game studio", how do we translate this to a specific design system?

## Solution: Keyword-Based Trend Matching

The `match-trend.ts` script uses a keyword dictionary to map natural language to our catalog of 24 design trends.

## Algorithm Behavior

1. **Positive Match (1.0 points):** Full keyword in description
2. **Partial Match (0.5 points):** Word contains keyword (min 4 chars)
3. **Negative Match (-0.5 points):** Incompatible keyword present
4. **Description Match (0.3 points):** Word appears in trend's description

## Confidence Scoring

```
confidence = min(0.95, 0.5 + (gap / topScore) * 0.5)
```

- If only one trend matches: 95% confidence
- If two trends are close: Lower confidence suggests blend
- If many trends match equally: Consider asking user to clarify
